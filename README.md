# Vocabulizer

## Overview

Vocabulizer is a [Skylight](https://skylight.digital) project in partnership with [USDS](https://www.usds.gov/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/). Our goal is to improve
vocabulary related services and workflows at the CDC.
  
## Getting started

### Running the Vocabulizer Service

The vocabulizer service can be run using Docker (or any other OCI container runtime e.g., Podman), or directly from the Python source code.

#### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

To run the vocabulizer service with Docker follow these steps.
1. Confirm that you have Docker installed by running `docker -v`. If you do not see a response similar to what is shown below, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.
```
โฏ docker -v
Docker version 26.1.1, build 4cf5afa
``` 
2. Run the service with `docker compose up --build`.

Congratulations, the vocabulizer service should now be running on `localhost:8000`!

#### Running from Python Source Code

We recommend running the vocabulizer service from a container, but if that is not feasible for a given use case, it may also be run directly from Python using the steps below.

1. Ensure that both Git and Python 3.12 or higher are installed.
2. Clone the vocabulizer repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/vocabulizer`.
3. Navigate to `./vocabulizer`.
4. Make a fresh virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
5. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (MacOS and Linux), `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows Command Prompt), or `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows PowerShell).
5. Install all of the Python dependencies for the vocabulizer service with `pip install -r requirements.txt` into your virtual environment.
6. Run the FHIR Converter on `localhost:8000` with `fastapi dev`. 

### The API 

When viewing these docs from the `/docs` endpoint on a running instance of the vocabulizer service or the vocabulizer website, detailed documentation on the API will be available below.
